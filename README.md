# gonix
Clones of the *nix tools written in go

# Bugs
Many tools do not exist and many features are not implemented.
I used "flag" to do the flag-parsing, it is a little strict (ie. no combining flags like -xyz instead of -x -y -z).

# License
I am releasing this under the GPLv3 with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY OR LIABILITY.

This is just one of my coding experiments and should not be used to actually replace your system's tools.
Again, I am not liable for whatever these programs might do. Use them at your own risk.
