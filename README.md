# gonix
Clones of the *nix tools written in go

# Bugs
Many tools do not exist and many features are not implemented.
I used "flag" to do the flag-parsing, it is a little strict (ie. no combining flags like -xyz instead of -x -y -z).

# License
I am releasing this under the terms of the GNU GPLv3 license with **ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY OR LIABILITY**.
I have included the license in the file LICENSE.md

This is just one of my coding experiments and should not be used to actually replace your system's tools.
I am not liable for whatever these programs might do. Use them at your own risk.
